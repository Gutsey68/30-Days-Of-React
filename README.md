A library is a collection of reusable functions, objects, and classes designed to solve common problems in software development. It provides specific functionality that developers can use without having to reinvent the wheel.

## What is a single page application?

A single page application is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app. This provides a smoother and faster user experience, similar to that of desktop applications.

## What is a component?

A component is a reusable, self-contained piece of the user interface in a React application. Each component manages its own state and rendering logic, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

## What does a web application or a website (composed of) have?

A web application or website is composed of several elements: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and often libraries and frameworks to simplify development and improve performance.

# Why React?

## Why did you choose to use React?

I chose to use React because of its popularity, flexibility, and ability to create responsive and high-performance user interfaces. The component-based structure makes code reuse and management easier.

## What measures do you use to know popularity?

To measure popularity, you can look at metrics such as GitHub stars, the number of contributors, downloads, usage statistics, community support, and trends on platforms like Stack Overflow and Google Trends.

## What is more popular, React or Vue?

As of now, React is generally considered more popular than Vue, based on metrics like GitHub stars, usage in large-scale projects, job market demand, and community size.

## What is babel?

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript code into a form that can run in older browsers. It also converts JSX into JavaScript.

## What is a transpiler?

A transpiler is a tool that translates code from one programming language to another, often converting newer language features into an older, more compatible version.
