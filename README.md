# What is React?

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of fast, interactive, and dynamic web applications using reusable components.

## What is a library?

A library is a collection of reusable functions, objects, and classes designed to solve common problems in software development. It provides specific functionality that developers can use without having to reinvent the wheel.

## What is a single page application?

A single page application is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app. This provides a smoother and faster user experience, similar to that of desktop applications.

## What is a component?

A component is a reusable, self-contained piece of the user interface in a React application. Each component manages its own state and rendering logic, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

## What is the latest version of React?

The latest version of React is 18.2.0 (as of the date of this response).

## What is DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of the document as a tree, where each node is an object representing a part of the document (elements, attributes, text, etc.).

## What is React Virtual DOM?

The React Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize UI updates by only changing the parts of the real DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.

## What does a web application or a website (composed of) have?

A web application or website is composed of several elements: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and often libraries and frameworks to simplify development and improve performance.

# Why React?

## Why did you choose to use React?

I chose to use React because of its popularity, flexibility, and ability to create responsive and high-performance user interfaces. The component-based structure makes code reuse and management easier.

## What measures do you use to know popularity?

To measure popularity, you can look at metrics such as GitHub stars, the number of contributors, downloads, usage statistics, community support, and trends on platforms like Stack Overflow and Google Trends.

## What is more popular, React or Vue?

As of now, React is generally considered more popular than Vue, based on metrics like GitHub stars, usage in large-scale projects, job market demand, and community size.

# JSX

## What is an HTML element?

An HTML element is a building block of an HTML document, defined by a start tag, content, and an end tag (e.g., `<div>content</div>`).

## How to write a self-closing HTML element?

A self-closing HTML element is written with a slash before the closing angle bracket (e.g., `<img />`, `<br />`).

## What is an HTML attribute? Write some of them

An HTML attribute provides additional information about an element. Examples include `id`, `class`, `src`, `href`, and `alt`.

## What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX is compiled to JavaScript by tools like Babel.

## What is babel?

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript code into a form that can run in older browsers. It also converts JSX into JavaScript.

## What is a transpiler?

A transpiler is a tool that translates code from one programming language to another, often converting newer language features into an older, more compatible version.

# JSX Elements

## What is a JSX element?

A JSX element is a JavaScript object that describes a part of the user interface. It looks similar to HTML but can include JavaScript expressions and components.

# JavaScript Modules and Packages

## What is a module?

A module is a self-contained piece of code that encapsulates functionality and can be reused across different parts of an application. Modules help in organizing and managing code by splitting it into smaller, manageable parts.

## What is a package?

A package is a collection of one or more modules that are bundled together and can be distributed and shared via a package manager like NPM. A package often includes additional metadata, such as the name, version, and dependencies.

## What is the difference between a module and a package?

A module is a single piece of code, typically a JavaScript file, that exports functionality. A package, on the other hand, is a collection of modules, along with additional metadata, that can be published and shared using a package manager.

## What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript. It allows developers to install, share, and manage dependencies (packages) for their projects. NPM also provides a registry where packages can be published and shared with the community.

## What is Webpack?

Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets that represent those modules. Webpack allows developers to use modern JavaScript features, handle different types of assets (CSS, images), and optimize the output for production.

## How do you create a new React project?

You can create a new React project using the Create React App tool. This tool sets up a new React project with a standard configuration. Here is how you can create a new React project:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-new-project
cd my-new-project
npm start
```

# JavaScript Functions and React Components

## What is the difference between a regular function and an arrow function?

The main differences between regular functions and arrow functions in JavaScript are:

1. **Syntax**: Arrow functions have a more concise syntax compared to regular functions.
2. **`this` Context**: Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. They inherit `this` from the surrounding scope, which makes them useful in situations where you want to preserve the context of `this`.
3. **Arguments Object**: Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object. If you need to access the `arguments` object, you must use a regular function.

## What is a React Component?

A React Component is a reusable piece of the user interface. It can be a class or a function that returns a React element. Components can accept inputs (called "props") and manage their own state to render dynamic content.

## How do you make a React functional component?

A React functional component is a JavaScript function that returns a React element. Functional components can accept props as an argument and use hooks to manage state and lifecycle events.

## What is the difference between a pure JavaScript function and a functional component?

The main differences are:

1. **Return Value**: A pure JavaScript function can return any type of value, while a functional component must return a React element.
2. **Usage**: A pure JavaScript function is used for general programming tasks, whereas a functional component is specifically used to define part of the UI in a React application.
3. **Lifecycle**: Functional components can use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and lifecycle events, which is not applicable to regular JavaScript functions.

## How small is a React component?

A React component can be as small as you want. It can represent a single HTML element like a button or an input field, or it can be a larger component that includes many child components. The idea is to break down the UI into small, reusable pieces.

## Can we make a button or input field component?

Yes, you can create a button or input field component in React. These components can be as simple or complex as needed and can encapsulate functionality and styling specific to buttons or input fields.

# React Props

## What is props in a React component?

Props (short for "properties") are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component in React. They allow data and event handlers to be passed down the component tree, enabling communication between components.

## How do you access props in a React component?

In a functional component, props are accessed through the function's parameters. In a class component, props are accessed via `this.props`.

## What data types can we pass as props to components?

You can pass various data types as props to components, including:

- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans
- Arrays
- Objects
- Functions
- React elements
- Other components

## What is a propTypes?

`propTypes` is a property used to specify the expected data types and structure for the props a component should receive. It helps with type-checking and ensures that the component is used correctly. This is typically done using the `prop-types` library.

## What is a default propTypes?

Default `propTypes` are specified using the `defaultProps` property on a component. They define the default values for props that are not provided by the parent component. This ensures that the component has sensible defaults and can function correctly even if some props are missing.

# JavaScript Arrays and Destructuring

## Why do you need to map an array?

Mapping an array is essential because it allows you to transform each element in the array and return a new array with the transformed elements. The `map` method applies a given function to each element in the array, creating a new array with the results. This is particularly useful when you need to perform the same operation on each element, such as formatting data, adding properties, or converting values.

## Why do we need keys during mapping an array?

Keys are needed when mapping an array in React to help identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. Keys should be unique for each element in the array and are essential for React's reconciliation process. This helps React optimize rendering by reusing existing elements instead of re-rendering the entire list, improving performance and efficiency.

## What is the importance of destructuring your code?

Destructuring is important because it allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables in a more concise and readable manner. It simplifies the syntax for accessing nested values and helps avoid repetitive code, making it easier to work with complex data structures.

## Does destructuring make your code clean and easy to read?

Yes, destructuring makes your code cleaner and easier to read. By reducing the need for repetitive and verbose code, it highlights the important parts of the code and makes the intention clearer. Destructuring helps to quickly identify which properties or elements are being accessed or used, improving overall code readability and maintainability.

# JavaScript and React Components

## How do you write a pure JavaScript function?

A pure JavaScript function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not cause any observable side effects. It does not modify any external state and relies solely on its input parameters.

## What is inheritance and how do you make a child from a parent class?

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a class (child class) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent class). This allows the child class to reuse the code defined in the parent class and also extend or override the behavior. To create a child class from a parent class, the child class uses the `extends` keyword followed by the parent class name.

## What is a class based React component?

A class based React component is a component defined using ES6 class syntax. It extends `React.Component` and must include a `render` method that returns a React element. Class based components can have state and lifecycle methods.

## What is the difference between functional React component and class based React component?

The main differences are:

- **Syntax**: Functional components are simple JavaScript functions, while class based components use ES6 class syntax.
- **State and Lifecycle**: Functional components use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and lifecycle, whereas class based components use `this.state` and lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`.
- **Performance**: Functional components with hooks can be more performant because they avoid some of the overhead associated with classes.

## When do we need to use class based components instead of functional components?

Class based components are typically used when you need to use lifecycle methods that are not easily replicated with hooks, or when working on an existing codebase that already uses class based components. However, with the introduction of hooks, the need for class based components has significantly decreased.

## What is the use cases of class based component?

Class based components are useful when:

- You need to manage state and lifecycle methods in a more traditional object-oriented approach.
- You are working with an older codebase that heavily uses class based components.
- You need to use lifecycle methods that might be complex to handle with hooks.

## Which type of component do you use most frequently? functional or class-based component?

Most developers now use functional components more frequently due to their simplicity and the power of hooks, which allow functional components to manage state and lifecycle effectively.

## What is React life cycle?

React life cycle refers to the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of a component's existence. These stages include mounting (when the component is first rendered), updating (when the component's state or props change), and unmounting (when the component is removed from the DOM). Lifecycle methods allow developers to run code at specific points in a component's life.

## What is state in React?

State in React is an object that holds data that influences the output of a component. It allows components to create and manage their own data that can change over time. State is managed within the component and can be updated using the `setState` method in class based components or the `useState` hook in functional components.

# React State and Props

## What is state in React?

State in React is an object that holds data or information about the component. It is managed within the component and can change over time. The state is used to create dynamic and interactive components by allowing components to respond to user input, network responses, and other events.

## What is the difference between props and state in React?

The main differences between props and state in React are:

- **Props**:

  - Props (short for "properties") are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.
  - Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the receiving component.
  - Props are used to pass data and event handlers to child components.

- **State**:
  - State is an internal object managed within a component.
  - State is mutable, meaning it can be updated by the component.
  - State is used to keep track of data that changes over time and affects the rendering of the component.

## How do you access state in a React component?

In a class-based component, state is accessed using `this.state`. In a functional component, state is accessed using the `useState` hook.

## How do you set a state in a React component?

In a class-based component, state is set using the `setState` method. In a functional component, state is set using the `setState` function returned by the `useState` hook.

### Class-based Component:

- Access state: `this.state`
- Set state: `this.setState({ key: value })`

### Functional Component with Hooks:

- Access state: `[state, setState] = useState(initialValue)`
- Set state: `setState(newValue)`

# Conditional Rendering in React

## What is conditional rendering?

Conditional rendering in React refers to the ability to render different UI elements or components based on certain conditions. It allows developers to dynamically control what is displayed on the screen depending on the state or props of the component.

## How do you implement conditional rendering?

There are several ways to implement conditional rendering in React:

1. **Using if/else statements**:
   This is the most straightforward way to conditionally render elements. However, it cannot be directly used inside JSX. You need to put the logic outside the JSX return statement.

2. **Using ternary operators**:
   The ternary operator is a concise way to conditionally render elements within JSX. It is suitable for simple conditions.

3. **Using logical && operator**:
   The logical AND (`&&`) operator can be used to render an element only if a condition is true. If the condition is false, nothing is rendered.

4. **Using switch/case statements**:
   For multiple conditions, using a switch statement outside of the JSX can help organize and manage the different rendering options.

5. **Using immediate if (IIFE) or self-invoking functions**:
   This is useful when you need to include more complex logic within the JSX return statement.
